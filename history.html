        <h1>Historical Context</h1>
        <p>The following is the introduction that Thor Sundby included in his 1873 critical edition of <em>Liber Consolationis et Consilli</em> published by The Chaucer Society in London. 
            Please be patient as we are working on adding his footnotes, making his page referrences compatiable with our site, and comparing his research to modern scholarship.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Though Albertano of Brescia even in his own day appears to have won great renown by his writings, and to have have played an active and not inconsiderable part in the political 
            events that took place in Brescia and Northern Italy during the first half of the thirteenth century, yet he has found no contemporaneous biographer; nor have later middle-age 
            writers been sufficiently inquisitive to trace his career, or communicative enough to leave any particular notice of his life. The Brescian chronicler Jacopo Malvezzi, who began 
            his annals in the year 1412, though he speaks of Albertano with the greatest consideration, has not even thought of mentioning, in the chapter he consecrates to his memory, any 
            of the particulars he might have borrowed from Albertano's own writings. “At that epoch (1235),” he says, “the lawyer Albertano, of the family of the Albertani, held a 
            conspicuous place as a member of this community. He was an eminent man, full of wisdom, and author of many moral treatises, which he wrote admirably well for the advantage of 
            his fellow-citizens and other readers.”  So, the only sources from which we can draw any information on the life of Albertano are, besides a few historical documents in which 
            he is mentioned, the scanty notices contained in the introductions and explicits of his writings.  There he always calls himself <em>causidicus Brixiensis de ora Sanctae Agathae</em> 
            or <em>causidicus de Sancta Agatha</em>, which, however, does not imply, that he was born at Brescia, or especially in the quarter of S. Agatha, but only that he was a judge at 
            Brescia, and lived there.  At all events he was a citizen of that community; and, as Jacopo Malvezzi and others speak of his family and himself as of Brescians, we have no reason 
            to doubt that this town was his birth-place.
        </p>

        <p>The year of Albertano's birth is not known; yet, by inferences drawn from the data afforded by his writings, it will be possible to come to an approximative determination. From the 
            dedication of his <em>Liber Consolationis et Consilii</em>, written in the year 1246, we learn that his son Giovanni at that time not only studied the chirurgical art, but must have begun 
            to practise it; he cannot therefore have been less than about twenty years old. As Albertano evidently in the same manner dedicated his book <em>De Arte Loquendi et Tacendi</em> and the 
            <em>De Amore et Dilectione Dei</em> etc. to his other sons, Stefano and Vincenzio, at their entrance into practical life, they must have been of about the same age when they received from 
            their father those writings full of instruction and advice, destined to guide them on their way through life. Now the treatise <em>De Amore et Dilectione Dei</em>, dedicated to the eldest 
            son, Vincenzio, was written in the year 1238; and if the eldest son was at that time about twenty years old, it is likely that Albertano had married in 1217. Should we suppose him 
            to have wedded at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five years, we may conclude that he was born in 1193 or 1192. At all events we may safely state that Albertano was born in the last 
            decennium of the twelfth century.
        </p>

        <p>At that period Brescia was rising fast in wealth and power. The league formed by the Lombard cities, 1167, had in the year 1176 conquered Frederick Barbarossa in the battle of Legnano. 
            A truce of six years followed; by the treaty of Constance, 1183, the Lombard cities recognized indeed the emperor as their liege lord, but at the same time reserved to themselves such 
            extensive liberty, that they in fact were almost entitled to the name of indepencent republics. The emperor confirmed their right of fortification, of confederation and of making war 
            and peace; he recognized their right of electing their own consuls, to whom he was only to grant the investiture of the empire; and he allowed them independent exercise of jurisdiction, 
            except in cases of appeal, as to which he reserved his influence through the podestà. Brescia, already possessed of independent jurisdiction even in cases of appeal, appears moreover 
            to have obtained by special favour the privilege of appointing its consuls without imperial investiture.  Such were the brilliant results of the confederation formed by the rich Lombard 
            communities for the purpose of delivering themselves from the German sway. But no sooner had the common enemy yielded to their resistance, than dissension arose among the confederated 
            cities, and among the different factions of each community. It is not our object to write the history of Brescia during the following forty-three years (1183&#8211;1226); but it is not out 
            of purpose to recall to the mind of the reader, that it was an almost unbroken chain of wars, of feuds, of quarrels and struggles between republican and feudal elements between Guelfs 
            and Ghibellines, between commoners and nobles. Yet the commerce and industry of Brescia, whose warlike and valiant inhabitants were generally successful in their contests with 
            neighbouring communities, do not appear to have suffered seriously from all these troubles, for during this period it was continually increasing in wealth, in territory and political influence.
        </p>

        <p>It was under such circumstances that Albertano grew up, bred to the law. They were a school that might have developed very different abilities; indeed, at a later period we find him 
            employed not only in missions in which he might avail himself of his juridical knowledge, but in such as presupposed military talents; and, amidst the stir of an eventful life, he 
            appeared a keen observer, well aware of the inconveniences always inseparable from liberty when it does not submit to law.
        </p>

        <p>Though Albertano, in all probability, made his entrance in public life long before 1226, he is not till then mentioned in any document. In 1220 Frederick the Second had been crowned 
            in Rome by Pope Honorius the Third as German-Roman emperor. The Lombard republics, which were well acquainted with his intention of maintaining vigorously his imperial prerogatives, 
            had been alarmed; but his quarrels with the pope having prevented him from any serious step towards the execution of his projects, they had put off the revival of their ancient 
            confederation. At the beginning of the year 1226, the demonstrations of the emperor became still more threatening; and accordingly the Lombard cities began to think of organizing 
            a powerful resistance against the pretensions of the emperor. In March of the same year their delegates assembled in the Brescian borough Mosio, and renewed the league for a space 
            of twenty-five years. This convention was confirmed by oath before the podestàs of different cities; so in April at Brescia, where we find Albertano as the representative of this 
            community.  The Swabian did not feel strong enough for an attack; he only pronounced the ban of the empire over the refractory communities and retired to Apulia. In 1227 a sort of 
            truce was brought about by Honorius the Third and Gregory the Ninth ; and Frederick departed for the Holy Land in the autumn of 1228. On his return from the crusade the fears of the 
            Lombards were again aroused, and their league was renewed. When Ferrara and Mantua acceded to the confederation in July 1231, we once more find Albertano as one of the delegates of 
            Brescia, the other being Lanfranchino de Rodengo. Here as in 1226 he is called judge (<em>judex</em>). Thus we learn that the word causidicus, which is used by Albertano himself and which 
            in mediaeval Latin had the double signification of judge and advocate, when speaking of Albertano must be rendered by judge. Federico Odorici reads Albertus instead of Albertano, 
            and expressly warns us against confounding this Albertus with the renowned Albertano; but as he quotes, though incorrectly, Muratori as is sole authority, we suppose his assertion 
            to rest on a mere mistake.
        </p>

        <p>We pass rapidly over the resultless negociations of the emperor with the pope and the Lombards, the quarrels of the republics, the efforts of Giovanni da Schio for restoring peace 
            and concord, the rebellion of Frederick's son King Henry, his alliance with the Lombards, and Frederick's departure for Germany. The emperor, having at last obtained assistance 
            from his German subjects, reappeared in Italy, 1237, at the head of a strong army, and overthrew the Lombards, (November of the same year) in the battle of Cortenuova, on the Oglio. 
            Most of the republics surrendered; only Brescia, Bologna, Milano and Piacenza hesitated. They were willing to make their submission on reasonable conditions; but as the emperor 
            asked submission at discretion they were driven to despair, and resolved to stand to the last. Reinforced by fresh German troops, Frederick, at the head of his motley army of 
            Germans, Italians, Englishmen and Saracens moved towards Brescia. At the beginning of August 1238 he arrived below the walls of the city, and began the memorable siege that 
            checked the progress of the victorious emperor. He only succeeded in taking some of the castles in the neighbourhood, among which was that of Gavardo,  situated not far from the 
            lake of Garda, North-East of Brescia, on the way to Salò. This castle had in 1237 rebelled against Brescia,  but must by force or for love have returned into obedience, since we 
            learn from Albertano that he had been appointed its commander during the siege, a sign of the confidence of his fellow-citizens in the firmness of his character and his military 
            skill. Yet he was obliged to surrender on the twenty-sixth of August 1238.
        </p>

        <p>It was in his prison at Cremona that Albertano composed his first and most extensive treatise <em>De Amore et Dilectione Dei et Proximi et Aliarum Rerum, et de Forma Vitae</em>, dedicated 
            to his eldest son, Vincenzio.  Whether Albertano was released in October, when Frederick was obliged to give up his unsuccessful siege of Brescia, we do not know, but think it 
            highly probable. In 1245 Albertano composed his treatise <em>De Arte</em> (or <em>Doctrina</em>) <em>Loquendi et Tacendi</em>, dedicated to his son Stefano, and in 1246 the third treatise 
            <em>Liber Consolationis et Consilii</em>, dedicated to his son Giovanni.  These discourses, written in Latin, exist in a great number of manuscripts; but, as it seems, 
            bibliographers do not know the existence of an impression mentioned by Casimir Oudin, who says that in the year 1680 he had seen in the library of a monastery in Artois a copy 
            printed at Coni, 1507, in 4to, by Master Viotus de Dulcis. If the copies of this edition have not disappeared altogether, they must at all events be extremely rare. 
            The little essay <em>De Arte Loquendi et Tacendi</em> has been printed separately in many editions at the end of the fifteenth century. All three treatises, were in the 
            thirteenth century, twice translated into Italian; the first time about the year 1270. This version, which is quoted in the <em>Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</em>, 
            was edited in 1610 by Bastiano de' Rossi, and often reprinted. The second time, they were translated by Soffredi del Grazia, before the year 1278; and this text was edited 
            in 1832 by Sebastiano Ciampi.
        </p>

        <p>Besides these treatises Albertano wrote, likewise in Latin, five <em>Sermones</em> or speeches, in the manuscripts generally grouped in the same order. From the first of them we learn that 
            he lived, at the end of 1243, at Genova, whither he had probably accompanied his countryman Emanuele Maggi, who had been elected podestà of that city. According to custom the 
            foreign podestà, generally elected for three years, took with him his judges and notaries. Among the judges of Emanuele Maggi was, no doubt, Albertano, when he made before the 
            judges and notaries of Genova his speech <em>Super confirmatione vitae illorum</em>.  The other four orations were apparently addressed to the Brescian judges or lawyers and the Franciscan 
            friars, when they were “as usual" assembled at Midlent in the monastery of that order, for the purpose of feeding the poor. They are composed quite in the same manner as Albertano's 
            other writings, in an edifying and religious rather than academical strain, and might very well be called sermons. So we have no reason whatever to adopt the name of <em>Academy</em>, 
            bestowed upon those assemblies by Federico Odorici. Three of these speeches are without date, whereas the last is said to have been made in the year 1250. A treatise <em>De Epistolari Dictamine</em>, 
            ascribed to Albertano by Huillard-Bréholles, is mentioned by nobody else.  Whether Albertano is really the author of this piece, is a question we must leave undetermined. Not so the 
            assertion of Crescimbeni, repeated by Quadrio, that certain manuscripts of Albertano's works should contain poems from his hand, which has been proved to be decidedly false. 
        </p>

        <p>Resuming the preceding notices on the life of Albertano, we find that it presents two distinct periods, one of active participation in public affairs, until 1238, the other of literary production, 
            from 1238 until 1250. That his occupations during  the latter years were owing to his withdrawing from public life, we may guess, though not assert, from some words (below p. 65&#8211;66) in which he 
            blames those decisions in state affairs that “follow the pleasure of the multitude, and not the wisdom of the few.” Of his life after 1250, when he was about 58 years old, we know nothing; nor 
            do we know when he died. Fe. Odorici tells us indeed, referring to Mazzuchelli, yet without saying where, that he died about 1270; but this is certainly a mere supposition. 
        </p>

        <!--Some divider here.-->

        <p>Tiraboschi has passed a very harsh judgment on the writings of Albertano. “From this author,” he says, “we must not expect method in treating his subject, nor force of reasoning nor precision 
            of ideas. He almost contents himself with joining together passages from the Scripture, and from many sacred and profane authors, on the matter he discusses; and at the time when he lived it 
            is no little praise that he could do thus much.” This judgment has been repeated, almost word for word, by Nannucci, but rejected by Paulin Paris, who supposes Tiraboschi had not even read 
            Albertano's Book of Consolation and Counsel, which looking not at its bulk, but its literary merit, is his principal work.  Albertano is so far from deserving any reproach for want of method, 
            that on the contrary he is perhaps rather too methodical, too exact in enumerating all sorts of cases, too exuberant in classifications, always delighting in scholastic distinctions, a fault 
            the more obvious in his Book of Consolation because it appears particularly in the replies of the female interlocutor. As to his reasoning, it may now and then be too broad or a little childish, 
            but generally speaking it is strong and demonstrative. Sometimes, it is true, he gives an authority for a reason; but in this he does not differ from many even esteemed writers of our own century, 
            though they have greater skill in turning their phrases so as to make this fault less obvious. Besides, the thirteenth century, as well as the latter part of the twelfth, was an age of compilation, 
            fond of authorities in all departments of human science, and particularly in morals. So strong was this relish for moral sentences, that sometimes even the most trivial passages in ancient writers 
            were, by some&#8212;generally, we presume, involuntary&#8212;alteration, transformed so as to satisfy it, as may be seen from the specimen given in the third note p. 55&#8211;56 below. Thus, we have every reason 
            to believe that if Albertano had not shared the taste then prevailing, and instead of quoting a great many authors had used his own words, his Book of Consolation would have lost as much in 
            popularity as it might have won in originality. One circumstance that has certainly contributed very much to the popularity of this treatise, is the form of tale chosen by the author for conveying 
            to the public his moral instructions in general, and for inculcating sounder principles regarding feuds and private vengeance, which is more particularly his scope in the Book of Consolation. 
            There can be no doubt that this form has rendered it more attractive to its readers. And yet the tale is partly allegorized by Albertano himself (see p. 2 cf. p. 84), and Prudentia, if not Melibeus, 
            must at least in part be considered as an allegorical personage. As Albertano's Book of Consolation and Counsel, looking at its title and the dialogue, has some resemblance to the book of Boethius on 
            the Consolation of Philosophy, his Prudentia is not without a certain analogy to the <em>Philosophia of Boethius</em>.  But it is from a passage of Cassiodorus, quoted by Albertano (p. 20), that he has taken 
            the name of his heroine, if we may call her so, and the general idea of her character: <em>Superavit cuncta infatigabilis et expedita prudentia</em>. The name of Melibeus, the outline of his person, and the 
            first sketch of the whole narrative, he found in this distich, which he (p. 53) wrongly ascribes to Martialis:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Consilio juvenum fidis, Melibee; ruinam</p>
            <p>Expectare potes, dum sine consilio es.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Albertano derives the name of his hero from <em>mel</em> and <em>bibens</em> (p. 83), and describes him as an honest but rash and hotbrained young man of high rank,  indulging himself in the pleasures of life and confiding 
            too much in his riches. His wife, Prudentia, on the other hand, is painted as a strong and noble-minded but kindhearted and religious woman, far superior to her husband in knowledge and intelligence, 
            though not unacquainted with those small and harmless, or at least well-meant artifices and stratagems that are so characteristic of her sex. Unhappily, Albertano has identified her with himself to 
            such a degree, that she not only quotes all sorts of authors even Albertano himself, but reasons in juridical matters like an accomplished lawyer, equally versed in the Digest and the Decretals. 
            Indeed if we did not remember her allegorical dignity, we might be tempted to use a modern term and call her a most terrible blue-stocking. Yet with this restriction Albertano shows himself in the 
            narrative part of his book upon the whole a tolerably skilful painter, not only of characters but also of scenes, as may be seen in his description of tumultuary council (p. 6&#8211;11).
        </p>

        <p>The dialogue parts of the book, like the other writings of Albertano, are interwoven with very copious quotations, and so far not original; yet his personal opinion does not disappear in this throng of sentences; 
            and, at all events, the system is his own. He is not free from digressions; he cannot withstand the temptation of a <em>by the bye</em>, for example in the chapters VI&#8211;X; but he notwithstanding safely leads his reader 
            to the goal he had proposed: condemnation of feuds and wilful wars, and submission to law. This is the principal tendency of his book, and very remarkable for the time when it was written; but it has another aim, 
            not less remarkable though perhaps less obvious. The superiority of Prudentia is not only due to her representing Wisdom itself: Albertano has certainly meant to glorify in her person Woman in general. Yet he did 
            not, of course, dream of such a thing as Woman's Emancipation and has accordingly represented her as the loving wife of Melibeus, submissive and obedient to her husband, at least in form, though by far his better 
            in almost every respect. If Albertano had not consecrated a chapter (ch. V) to the praise of woman, we might be uncertain as to his intention; but as it is no room is left for doubt. We cannot enter into any 
            further analysis; we have said enough to show that the Book of Consolation, though largely woven from the sayings of different authors by no means deserves the name of a mere patchwork.             
        </p>

        <p><em>Liber Consolationis et Consilii</em>, as mentioned above p. XII, has been printed in Latin and in Italian together with the other treatises of Albertano. Separately it has been translated into French, German, 
            Dutch, and perhaps into other languages. The French translation is not known to have been published, whereas both the Dutch translation (which is in verse) and the German have been printed, the latter even in five 
            editions. Besides the literal French transfer there exists another French version, or rather adaptation, <em>Le Livre de Mellibee et Prudence</em> by Jean de Meung. This adaptation, from which Geoffrey Chaucer has taken his 
            <em>Tale of Melibe</em>, has been printed several times: separately at the end of the XVth century, in 1504 together with the French translation of the <em>Solatium Ludi Scachorum</em> by Jacques de Cessoles, and in the edition of 
            <em>Le Ménagier de Paris</em>, the author of which has embodied it in his book, written about 1393, as containing in the person of Prudentia an excellent example for his wife. Though <em>le chevalier de la Tour Landry</em> has not 
            himself acted in the same way, yet we find, at least in the edition of 1517, the history of Melibeus printed as the last chapter of the book written by the knight in 1372 for the instruction of his daughters. 
        </p>

        <p>These additions are as many testimonies to the popularity of the French adaptation; and if we inquire the reason why the French and Chaucer have preferred it to the literal translation, the only answer accounting 
            for the fact is that Jean de Meung, by retrenching from the original those digressions and scholastic distinctions of which we have spoken above p. XV and XVII, had made it more acceptable to the public. So he 
            has omitted the chapters on wisdom and study (VI&#8211;X), the definition and derivation of <em>consilium</em> (p. 29&#8211;30) the greater part of the chapter <em>de cupiditate</em> (ch. XIII, p. 35&#8211;39) the classification of the seven species 
            of possibility (ch. XXXVI, p. 79&#8211;80) and the distinction of the fivefold will of God (ch. XXXVIII, p. 85&#8211;86). It is probably the same reason that induced Jean de Meung to leave out the enumeration of the eight 
            cases in which war is permitted (ch. XLIX, p. 108&#8211;112), though it is certainly more to the purpose, than his additions, which appear to have in part been borrowed from the treatise of Albertano 
            <em>De Amore et Dilectione Dei</em>. Jean de Meung has generally abridged, now and then in an unsparing manner; but as he has upon the whole followed his original, this will, even by a direct comparison, be of no little 
            use to those who study the <em>Tale of Melibe</em>. As for the literal translations, it is so evident that the Latin text offers an excellent means of, explaining, controlling and correcting them, that I need not enter 
            into any demonstration of it; so much the more, as I have on an earlier occasion endeavoured to show that such a collation, when possible, ought not to be neglected, and that accordingly editors of old texts should, 
            for that purpose, always do their best to find out the latin originals from which they have so often been derived.
        </p>

        <p>Also in another respect does the <em>Liber Consolationis et Consilii</em> prove important for the study of the middle ages. It is a curious fact that mediaeval moralists, as Gautier de Lille in his <em>Moralium Dogma</em>, frequently composed 
            their manuals almost exclusively from sayings of the ancients.  Albertano has not done so; he very often quotes the Bible and Christian writers; yet his treatise contains a considerable number of passages borrowed from 
            ancient philosophers. Generally he names his author, but often he does not, or, if he does, he substitutes one name for another. Even before the Chaucer Society, in October 1871, gave the impulse to this edition, I had 
            begun to verify his references and trace his sources, and have ever since spent a great deal of time and labour in these researches, which may indeed sometimes offer an interest similar to that of a hunter tracking his 
            game, but are upon the whole far from amusing. Yet I believe this is the only way in which we can ever hope to get a clear view of mediaeval knowledge of classicism. I cannot here give an account of the results of my 
            researches, but must refer to the marginal notes, the foot-notes and the index. I do not flatter myself to have advanced our knowledge of ancient scholarship during the middle-ages very much; yet I dare say that, if all 
            editors of such Latin texts would act in the same manner, we should not so ofen as now find a saying of some ancient author quoted and admired as an original word of a mediaeval compilator.
        </p>

        <p>The principles which I have followed in establishing the text I do not think it necessary to explain, having as I believe given, in the copious list of variants, a means of control and eventual correction, which I hope will 
            prove sufficient. I regret that circumstances have not permitted me to collate the Italian manuscripts (F&#8211;L) with the same exactness as the other codices, but only to consult them on difficult questions. Therefore, I have 
            grouped them as a class apart.
        </p>

        <p>Finally I have to perform the agreeable duty of acknolwedging the liberality with which the trustees of the National Library in Paris and the Royal Library in Berlin have enabled me to study the two manuscripts designed in 
            the list as B and D; and of thanking everybody who has facilitated the publication of this book.
