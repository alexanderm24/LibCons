          <head>Beginning of the Book of Consolation and Counsel</head>
          <ab>Since there are many who are so afflicted by adversities and weighed down in tribulations, and
              since they have neither counsel nor consolation on account of their disturbed souls—nor do they
              expect counsel or consolation from others—they become so distraught that they fall into worse,
              often evil, circumstances. For this reason, I took care to write down certain teachings for you,
              Johannus, my son, who heals with the art of surgery. God granting, from the little measure of my
              knowledge, you will not only be able to grant health to physical bodies, but you will even be able
              to bless others with counsel, consolation, and aid. Therefore, may you read the following tale
              zealously and ponder each of the written authorities diligently, and so, with divine grace
              bestowing, you will easily lead yourself and others in practicing good counsel. Here begins the
              tale.

          <head>Chapter I</head>
          <head>Example in the person of Melibeus</head>
            <p n="1.1">There once was a certain young man named Melibeus who was rich and powerful. One day he went for a walk, and after closing the front door he left his much-loved wife and daughter at home. Three neighbors, who were also long-established enemies of his, saw that he left and placing ladders entered the house through the windows. Having entered, they violently beat Melibeus&#8217; wife, Prudentia, and also her daughter. They injured the daughter all over, specifically with five wounds: in the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the nose, and hands. Leaving her half-dead, they departed.</p>
            <p n="1.2">Melibeus returned after some time, and once he saw this scene he began to rip out his hair, to let forth an intense moan, and to rend his clothes as if insane. But his wife who had been silent began to upbraid him insistently; still he kept shouting evermore. Having remembered the words of Ovid in his <title>Love&#8217;s Remedy</title>, she offered him a little saying:
              <said who="#prud" aloud="true" direct="true">
                <quote id="q001" type="classical" rend="blockquote">

                  <l>O&#8217;er the body of her son? Not then must she be counselled.</l>
                  <l>When she has shed tears and fulfilled her mind&#8217;s distress,</l>
                  <l>Then may words set a limit to that grief.</l>

Pamphilus de Amore, also referred to as Pamphilus, is a 12th century comedic Latin play in which the protagonist Pamphilus desires the virgin Galatea through a procuress, similar to the one in Ovid Amores Book 1.8. The play was most commonly used by young boys of the Middle Ages for the purpose of learning Latin.</note>

                    however weeping and shedding many tears is forbidden. Indeed we ought to keep in mind the saying coined by Seneca, who says:
                      <quote id="q009" type="classical">Let not your eyes be dry when we have lost a friend, nor let them overflow: we may weep, but we must not wail.</quote>

                    just as blessed Job, who—even when he lost all his sons and his status and endured many physical tribulations—always stood tall and gave thanks to the Lord, saying
                      <quote id="q017" type="biblicalOt">the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord</quote>

                    Therefore we must not grieve excessively about children or others we have lost, because what has happened cannot change; but rather we should rejoice about what we have, not grieve about what we have lost, whence someone wishing to console a father about the death of his son says: <quote type="unknown">Do not cry because you lost your good son, but instead rejoice that you had such a son.</quote>
                    And elsewhere Seneca also says:
                      <quote id="q019" type="classical">Nothing becomes offensive so quickly as grief; when fresh, it finds someone to console it and attracts one or another to itself; but after becoming chronic, it is ridiculed, and rightly. For it is either assumed or foolish.</quote>

                    And therefore you must certainly cast off temporal despair, for it is true what blessed Paul says in the middle of his Second Letter to the Corinthians:
                        <quote id="q020" type="biblicalNt">For worldly grief produces death, but the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation;</quote>

                    and therefore do not cast off sorrow, but instead take pains to cling to sorrow by day and by night because afterwards

                  <p n="2.4"> Melibeus responded:

                    &#8220;All that you said is true and useful; nevertheless my soul is so perturbed that I do not know what I should do.&#8221;

                  </p>
                  <p n="2.5"> And she said:
                    <said who="#prud" aloud="true" direct="true">
                    &#8220;Call together your true and faithful friends, whether blood kin or not, and diligently seek their counsel about this matter, and then steer yourself according to their counsel. For Solomon says:
                      <quote id="q024" type="biblicalOt">Do thou nothing without counsel, and He shall not punish thee.</quote>&#8221;

                  <p n="2.6">Melibeus called the abundant multitude of men, blood kin and not; amongst them were surgeons and physicians, old and young, including many neighbors, who respected him from fear than esteemed him with love, and even certain men—now friends once enemies—who returned in gratitude toward him. Many others also gathered there: flatterers, sycophants, and wise legal consultants. Once they had assembled, Melibeus told them everything that had happened to him. And when he asked for their counsel, he indicated a great desire to pursue vendetta within reason.
                  </p>
                  <p n="2.7">With the approval of the other surgeons, one of them stood up as representative and said,
                    <said who="#other" aloud="true" direct="true">
                    &#8220;The duty of doctors has always been to look after others, to benefit everyone, and to harm no one. Often it happens that parties in dispute inflict wounds on each other. Doctors should consult their art and administer healing to both parties with attentive care. Therefore, it is neither appropriate for us to give advice on vendetta or feud, nor to take sides; for this reason, we can hardly advise you to pursue vendetta. We have diligently inspected your daughter’s wounds and we will look after her with great attention day and night, and, God granting, even though she may be greatly wounded, we will nourish her to good and restored health.&#8221;
                    </said>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2.8">After the surgeon spoke, one of the physicians offered him counsel in a similar fashion with the will of his colleagues. He promised Melibeus medical help and on behalf of himself and the other physicians. Concerning feud and vendetta he said:
                    <said who="#other" aloud="true" direct="true">
                    &#8220;as we say in medicine afflictions are healed by their opposites, so too in feud and even vendetta, afflictions are then to be healed by their opposites.&#8221;
                    </said>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2.9">Melibeus’ neighbors and former enemies—those who had returned in gratitude for him—and the sycophants and flatterers all wore grief on their faces, almost weeping about that which had happened. They counselled him to pursue vendetta within reason and to settle the feud manfully. They commended lord  Melibeus both for his power and his wealth, and they numbered the multitude of his kin both of blood and not, of his in-laws and of his friends. They diminished the power of his enemies over him and destroyed their wealth with words.
